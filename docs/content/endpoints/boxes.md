title: Box - Boxes
---

# 1. Introduction

Boxes contain *events* that have a *type*.
In practice, most events will be of type `msg.text` or `msg.file`,
corresponding to the sending of messages (with either text or files in it) to the box.
There are however a few other events,
most of them describing a change of the *state* of the box.

[The shape and rules for box events are described here.](/concepts/box-events)


# 2. Boxes

## 2.1. Creating a Box

### 2.1.1. request

```bash
  POST https://api.misakey.com/boxes
```

_Headers:_
- :key: `Authorization` (opaque token) (ACR >= 1): no identity check, just a valid token is required.

_JSON Body:_
```json
    {
      "title": "RequÃªte RGPD FNAC",
      "public_key": "SXvalkvhuhcj2UiaS4d0Q3OeuHOhMVeQT7ZGfCH2YCw"
    }
```

Where `public_key` must be in **unpadded url-safe base64**.

Note that when a box is created, it already contains a first event
of type `create` that contains all the information about the creation of the box.

### 2.1.2. response

_
```bash
HTTP 201 Created
```

_JSON Body:_
```json
{{% include "include/box.json" %}}
```

The most important part is the `id` field
which must be used to interact with the box.

## 2.2. Getting a Box

### 2.2.1. request

```bash
  GET https://api.misakey.com/boxes/:id
```

_Headers:_

### 2.2.2. response

_Code:_
```bash
HTTP 200 OK
```

_JSON Body:_
```json
{{% include "include/box.json" %}}
```

## 2.3. Getting public info about a box

This endpoint does not need any valid token, but it needs a valid `other_share_hash`
corresponding to the box to get.

### 2.3.1. request

```bash
  GET https://api.misakey.com/boxes/:id/public?other_share_hash=
```

_Path Parameters:_

### 2.3.1. response

_Code:_

{
    "title": "<title of the box>"
}
```

## 2.4 Get the total count of boxes for the current user

Today only the total count of boxes is returned as an response header.

### 2.4.2. response

```

[
  {{% include "include/box-list.json" %}}
]
```

[Box admins](../../concepts/box-events/#21-admins) only are able to delete corresponding boxes.

A removed box sees its data completely removed from Misakey storage. This action is irreversible.

This action removes all data related to the box (events, key-shares...).

### 2.6.1 request

```bash
DELETE https://api.misakey.com/boxes/:id
```

_Headers:_
- :key: `Authorization` (opaque token) (ACR >= 1): the linked identity must be considered as a [box admin](../concepts/box-events/#21-admins).
